Description: lossless rearranger of MP3 files to make them smaller
 MP3packer is a program which attempts to save space of MP3 files by
 storing frame data in the smallest possible frame.
 .
 By default, the program generates the smallest MP3 possible (with the
 least padding), transforming Constant Bitrate (CBR) files in Variable
 Bitrate (VBR) files.  With files generated by the LAME MP3 encoder with
 "--preset insane", it can result in saving of up to 10% in size,
 losslessly.
 .
 Furthermore, it can turn VBR files into CBR for use with players which
 don't support VBR.
